# Assessment 1 - Database Project

This project contains a MySQL database for a hospital system, including tables for hospitals, doctors, patients, and prescriptions.  
The repository demonstrates database design, data import, and SQL queries to extract and analyse the data.

## Repository Contents

- **hospitals.sql**  
  Full MySQL database dump including table structures and imported data.

- **queries.sql**  
  A collection of SQL queries that answer the assessment tasks.  
  Each query is commented to explain what it does and why it is used.
  Where appropriate, alternative approaches are shown (e.g. using `WHERE` only vs `INNER JOIN`).
